I won't run.
They thought of everything.
You're incredible.
You're awesome.
Look up.
There's nothing except bits and bytes.
Yes.
Today is a new day.
Don't give up.
You're almost there.
Look around you.
Make some friends.
Enjoy what you're doing.
You're doing it right.
Nothing worth doing is easy.
Fill the world with love.
The world loves you.
I love you.
You're only human.
You're the greatest.
Don't let anybody bring you down.
Don't be afraid.
Go for what you want.
Go for what you need.
Aim as high as you can look.
You can do it.
It's never too late.
You can do anything.
